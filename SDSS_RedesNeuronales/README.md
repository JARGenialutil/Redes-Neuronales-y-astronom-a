Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) offers public data from spatial observations. This data consists of 10,000 observations taken by the SDSS. Each observations is described by 17 variables and 1 class which identifies a stellar object as an star, a galaxy or quasar.

This repository developes a multi-layer Neural Network to classify stellar objects given the data, using _python_ and _pytorch_.
